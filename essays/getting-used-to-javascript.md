## First introduction to Javascript

Taking ICS 314 at UH Manoa has really made sure that I am going to have to get used to javascript. Before I took this class, I did not have much experience with javascript. I’d heard about it before, but I have never actually used the language before. Although I still do not have much experience at this point, I am sure that taking ICS 314 will really help me develop my javascript skills. I’ve completed the introduction exercises on FreeCodeCamp, and I must say, doing those exercises will be beneficial for everyone. If you are new, they will be really beneficial for you to quickly learn the intro to Javascript, and if you are already familiar with Javascript, it can never hurt to refresh your memory.

## Software engineering

Although I don’t have any experience with software engineering yet, I am beyond excited to take ICS 314: Software Engineering. I am excited to really be able to apply my programming skills to be able to build something. Whilst I am still quite a javascript newbie, I am looking forward to seeing where I’ll be at the end of this class. I’m looking forward to being able to build a website or any other product for that matter! 


## Different languages

So far, using javascript has been good. I also have a little experience in programming in c and c++, and now I am adding javascript to that list. I liked programming in c and c++ because it is quite straightforward and the error notifications once you run the program really helped me out a lot to solve the issues. Javascript seems to be really straightforward and easy to use. I think it will be a good programming language for me because it is relatively easy to learn and so far I have fun with the experiences I’ve had with javascript. 

## High expectations 

I think I will gain a lot of coding experience during this class, because of the projects but also because of the WODs we do. WOD stands for “Workout Of the Day” and it gives us a programming exercise we have to do each week. I think this is a very engaging way to learn javascript. Although it might sound a bit stressful, having to take a programming test every week, we are offered enough ways to fully prepare for the WODs and do well. By preparing for the WOD, actually making the WOD, and evaluating the WOD, I will be working a lot with javascript and therefore I’ll definitely gain a lot of experience in javascript and I will be used to javascript in no-time!
