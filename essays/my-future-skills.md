If you’ve read my other other essay, you know I am not familiar with software engineering, yet. I am super excited about learning about software engineering, though. I am really excited to be able to build something using my programming skills. I feel like software engineering really connects coding and programming to the “real word”. In software engineering, we are using our skills to build software products, develop games, build websites, and all the other cool stuff!

## Skills

I really hope to develop good enough software engineering skills so that I can do all the things I named above. Assuming I do so, I would really like to gain a lot of experience building websites. I love design and technology, and building websites would really fit right up my alley. To make something look aesthetically pleasing and have it function perfectly, would really be something that I would be interested in. I’m also hoping to gain some skills and experience in building games. It’s not something I think I would want to do for a living, but for fun I think it would be really cool to be able to build games and develop things based on ideas you had in your head. I am also really looking forward to being able to code quickly and efficiently. When I'll start looking for a job, it is necessary that I am able to type out some working code right then and there. I am really excited to be able to ace coding interviews!

## Aiming high

So, although I don’t have any experience at this point, I’m aiming high in my skills and experiences I want to have in the future. I believe that by setting high goals for yourself, you’ll achieve more in life. I’m really excited to see where my software engineering journey is going to take me!
