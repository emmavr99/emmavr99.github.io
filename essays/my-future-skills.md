If you’ve read my other other essay, you know I am not familiar with software engineering, yet. I am super excited about learning about software engineering, though. I am really excited to be able to build something using my programming skills. I feel like software engineering really connects coding and programming to the “real word”. In software engineering, we are using our skills to build software products, develop games, build websites, and all the other cool stuff! Another cool thing about software engineering is, is that learning it makes me so much more eligible for a good job later. In a lot of job interviews, the interviewers tend to do certain "coding-interviews", where you are presented with a certain problem and you have to code your way out of it. In the software engineering class, ICS 314, that I am taking at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, we are learning how to handle this. 

## Skills

I really hope to develop good enough software engineering skills so that I can do all the things I named above. Assuming I do so, I would really like to gain a lot of experience building websites. I love design and technology, and building websites would really fit right up my alley. To make something look aesthetically pleasing and have it function perfectly, would really be something that I would be interested in. I’m also hoping to gain some skills and experience in building games. It’s not something I think I would want to do for a living, but for fun I think it would be really cool to be able to build games and develop things based on ideas you had in your head. I am also really looking forward to being able to code quickly and efficiently. When I'll start looking for a job, it is necessary that I am able to type out some working code right then and there. I am really excited to be able to ace coding interviews! As I mentioned before, ICS 314 is a class that is really preparing me for the future. 

## Artificial intelligence 

Besides being interested in software engineering, I am also really interested in Artificial Intelligence. I would love to work in the field of Artificial Intelligence once I have graduated college and hopefully have gotten my masters degree. I am expecting to graduate in the Spring of 2022 and then I am planning on getting my masters degree in Artificial Intelligence. I think that the field of AI is constantly changing and that really speaks to me. I am also really interested in psychology and I think in the AI field, you can combine computer science with psychology. I think gaining all this experience with coding and software engineering will only help me in my future to succesfully be able to find a job in the AI field.

## Aiming high

So, although I don’t have much experience at this point, I’m aiming high in my skills and experiences I want to have in the future. I believe that by setting high goals for yourself, you’ll achieve more in life. I have hopes and dreams of what my future skills will be, but really only time can tell. I for sure am going to work as hard as I can and take up as much knowledge as I can, so that I can get a job in the field I want to work in later on in life. I am excited to see where my journey will take me.
