I have just been introduced to coding standards and they have already made my coding-life easier. Coding standards are so much more than just the way your code looks. While many people see coding standards as the “rules” that describe where you should put spaces, curly braces, new lines, etc. However, I have learned that coding standards are actually really useful to help you learn the programming language and coding standards make it easier for you to collaborate with other people who are programming using the same coding standards.
