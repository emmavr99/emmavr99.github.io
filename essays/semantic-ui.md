Semantic UI has helped me a lot to make sure my website actually looks good. Even though it is definitely not simple, in the beginning, to use Semantic UI, the results are more than worth it.
The differents components of Semantic UI transformed me from a very basic-looking-website-builder into someone who can actually build an aesthetically pleasing-looking website. 
It has been difficult to grasp all the different concepts in the short amount of time I have known about Semantic UI, but, it is definitely worth it to invest your time into learning semantic UI. Here's why.

## I Can Actually Build a Decent-Looking Website
When I first was introduced to HTML and CSS, I thought it was very cool to see that I could build something. It wasn't very pretty, but it was something. I was wondering how the "real websites" were so pretty when my sites build with HTML and CSS were very basic. When I learned about Semantic UI, it all made more sense! There are quite a few frameworks that are of big help to make your product look good. There are many cool components in Semantic UI that will help you create a beautiful product. For example, while it might have been a struggle to create a well-spaced, fixed, borderless menu in just raw HTML, using Semantic UI, it is quite easy to implement. Semantic UI will also help you space your pictures correctly, create columns, buttons, labels, and all the other good stuff that you need to give your product a 'professional feel'.  

## Semantic UI Uses 'Natural Language'
It may be overwhelming learning about Semantic UI in the beginnning, because there are so many different components and options for you to use. However, the developers of Semantic UI seem to have wanted us to have a good time learning Semantic UI, because they uses mostly 'natural language', which makes it easier for us to understand it when we first read it. I followed a tutorial of Semantic UI on [PluralSight](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/semantic-ui-2-0), and even though it was a lot of new information, it was fairly easy for me to comprehend what was going because of the use 'natural language'. For example, you can create buttons with Semantic UI. To create a button, you put the following code in your .html file:
```
<button class="ui button">Some Text</button>
```
This will create a default gray button. If you want your button to be black, simply put the word 'black' in front of button in the class description, and this will make your button black:
```
<button class="ui black button">Some Text</button>
```
Instead of having to do work in css, you can very easily change the color by just putting it in the class name. The button was just an example, there are many other cool things we can change by just putting a word in front of the class.
