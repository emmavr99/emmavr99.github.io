To get a good, useful, and smart answer to your question, you have to pose your question in a certain way. You can't expect someone to give you the answer you need when you've asked your question in a very poorly formatted way. It also does not help if you haven't researched the web before posing your question somewhere, as people usually tend to be more helpful towards question-askers who show that they have really made an effort to get their question answered, but they simply couldn't find an answer, yet. There are quite some guidelines for posing your question in a smart way. If you ever plan on coming across as a good question-asker when posing a question, I’d highly recommend that you read the essay “How to ask questions the smart way” by Eric Raymond. In this essay, Raymond provides guidelines for effective interaction with the open source community. In this essay, I’ll show you what happens when you pose a question according to these guidelines, and what happens when you don’t! Spoiler alert: it is better to pose a question according to these guidelines.
