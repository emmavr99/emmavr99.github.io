In the summer of 2018, I competed with the Dutch water polo national youth team at the European Youth Championships and we won a bronze medal. Although this is not a 'normal' project, I have learned a lot from this experience. In the summer of 2018 I have learned qualities that will help me for the rest of my life. I have learned how to work hard even when you are exhausted, how to work towards a certain goal, and how to keep your mind sane and cool under a lot of stress and pressure.

I think that the qualities that I have learned will be beneficial to me for the rest of my life. In sports, all the emotions are heightened, but it is so important to be mentally strong and not to break under pressure. Performing at the highest stage in Europe has definitely made me mentally stronger and I have noticed and learned that I am now more calm in certain stressful situations. When there is a lot of pressure on a school project or test, it has definitely helped me that I can keep my head cool. This experience has made me perform better, in school, life and the pool.

Working towards a certain goal has definitely helped me in life as well. Being goal-oriented is really important when you are trying to meet certain deadlines and/or requirements. During the summer of 2018, we only had 1 goal: winning a medal. By setting goals early on, we know what we work for and what we work towards. It keeps picture in my head clear of what the end-result should look like. It has really made me work with a better focus on the goal of the task I am doing.
