For the final project of my software engineering class, ICS 314, we had to create a web application. Me and my group were assigned the problem that there are lots of students moving in and out of the dorms, for example, and they have no easy accessible way to buy and sell products that might be useful for the dorms. This is applicable to other aspects of university life as well. For example, to sell textbooks that you don't need anymore, or school supplies. We have created a web application called Manoa Bazaar that is designed for UHM community members to buy and sell products. The benefits of this are that all products sold will be close by, and thus there are no long waiting times or high shipping costs. It also is conventional that the products will be explicitly from UHM members, so they will be useful for the life at UH. 

## Manoa Bazaar 
The code for Manoa Bazaar can be found at our github repository called [Manoa Bazaar](https://github.com/manoa-bazaar/manoa-bazaar). Information on how to use the website, download our code, or just some general information about our project can be found [here](https://github.com/manoa-bazaar/manoa-bazaar.github.io). We divided this project up into three milestones where each milestone had a deadline. These milestones can be found [here](https://github.com/manoa-bazaar/manoa-bazaar/projects). Each of these milestones has tasks assigned to them that we had to finish before the due date of that milestone. Each task was assigned to one team member.
